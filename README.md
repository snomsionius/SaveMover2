# SaveMover2  
## The new and improved version of SaveMover  

Why do I need this tool ?  
It is actually quite simple. 
Have you ever played a game on two PCs simultaniously and the game had no cloud save so you had 2 different savegames?  
Well, that ends now. With using Savemover2, you can easily transfer savegames from one platform to the other.  
Just set up the program and start playing.
